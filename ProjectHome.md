Tart is intended for systems programming and high-performance applications such as audio synthesis applications, computer games, real-time video processing, and simulation. It can also be used as a systems programming language.

Tart borrows many ideas from other programming languages, including C, C++, Python, Java, C#, D, Haskell, Ruby, Scala and many others. At the same time, it also includes a number of features not seen in any of these languages.

Tart is a statically-typed language that has been designed for high efficiency. Tart allows you to get “close to the metal”, in the sense that you get access to the details of the native platform. At the same time, Tart is a very high level language which supports things like type deduction, multi-method dispatch and metaprogramming.

Tart is designed to be easy to learn, but its also designed to be “expert-friendly”. Like a musical instrument, Tart enables a true master to create “virtuoso performances” of excellence and creative power.
